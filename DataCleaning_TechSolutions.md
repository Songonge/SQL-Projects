## 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧
This project focuses on cleaning data for TechSolutions Ltd., which specializes in developing software products and services. Due to internal mismanagement and inconsistent data collection methods, the company has a lot of dirty data. 
Knowing that data cleaning is crucial in preparing data for analysis, the current project focuses on preparing the data for analysis. This will contribute to deriving meaningful insights and provide recommendations for the company to excel.

## 𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭
This project focuses on data cleaning to prepare a report on how long a project takes to be completed and how much was spent  on the project until completion. In what follows, a step-by-step description is provided of the data cleaning and transformation performed. 

## 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐈𝐧𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧
The data provided contained the following information:
* Number of rows: 1800 rows  
* Number of columns: 10 columns

### Description of Each Column
1. **project_id**: ID of the project
2. **project_name**: Name of the project
3. **start_date**: Date when the project started
4. **end_date**: Date when the project was completed (nullable)
5. **project_manager**: Name of the project manager
6. **team_members**: Team members involved in the project (comma-separated)
7. **status**: Current status of the project
8. **budget**: Budget allocated for the project
9. **expenditure**:  Money spent on the project
10. **client**: Name of the client company

> [!Important]
> I copied my raw data to a new table before starting the cleaning process. This was to ensure I have the original data to refer back to if you make a mistake or need to validate your changes later and to maintain data integrity! The following query was used:
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS [Learn SQL].dbo.tech_solutions_data1
SELECT * INTO [Learn SQL].dbo.tech_solutions_data1
FROM [Learn SQL].dbo.tech_solutions_data;
```

## 𝐓𝐚𝐬𝐤 𝟏: 𝐑𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐝 𝐃𝐮𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐑𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐫𝐝𝐬 
In this task, I checked for columns having the same row twice using the query below:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY project_name, start_date, end_date, project_manager, team_members, status, budget, expenditure, client ORDER BY project_name) 
	AS dup_data 
    FROM [Learn SQL].dbo.tech_solutions_data1) AS num_of_dup_rows
WHERE dup_data > 1;
```

### For the start_date column

1. Checked for invalid date entries in the start_date column and corrected them.
```sql
UPDATE [Learn SQL].dbo.tech_solutions_data1
SET start_date = CONVERT(DATE, start_date);
```
> [!Note]
> After running this query, everything after the last digit of the date was transformed into zero. So, to update the date column permanently, I needed to alter the table and the start_date column.  

2. To permanently store only the start_date without the time, I altered the start_date's data type.
```sql
ALTER TABLE [Learn SQL].dbo.tech_solutions_data1
ALTER COLUMN start_date DATE;
```

### For the end_date column
1. Checked for invalid date entries in the end_date column and corrected them.
```sql
UPDATE [Learn SQL].dbo.tech_solutions_data1
SET end_date = CONVERT(DATE, end_date);
```

2. To permanently store only the end_date without the time, I altered the end_date's data type.
```sql
ALTER TABLE [Learn SQL].dbo.tech_solutions_data1
ALTER COLUMN end_date DATE;
```

## 𝐓𝐚𝐬𝐤 𝟑: 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐫𝐝𝐢𝐳𝐞𝐝 𝐓𝐞𝐱𝐭 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐭𝐨 𝐅𝐢𝐱 𝐒𝐩𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐄𝐫𝐫𝐨𝐫𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐄𝐧𝐬𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲
The steps below were completed:

* **Cleaned any leading/trailing whitespaces in project_manager and status.**
```sql
UPDATE [Learn SQL].dbo.tech_solutions_data1
SET project_manager = TRIM(TRAILING '' FROM project_manager);
```

* **Standardized values in the status column** 
```sql
UPDATE [Learn SQL].dbo.tech_solutions_data1
SET status = 'pending'
WHERE status = 'pennding';
```

* **Standardized capitalization for project_name**
```sql
UPDATE [Learn SQL].dbo.tech_solutions_data1
SET project_name = 'Data Warehouse'
WHERE project_name = 'DATA WAREHOUSE';
```

```sql
UPDATE [Learn SQL].dbo.tech_solutions_data1
SET project_name = 'App Development'
WHERE project_name = 'APP DEVELOPMENT';
```

```sql
UPDATE [Learn SQL].dbo.tech_solutions_data1
SET project_name = 'IoT Automation'
WHERE project_name = 'IOT AUTOMATION';
```

```sql
UPDATE [Learn SQL].dbo.tech_solutions_data1
SET project_name = 'Cloud Migration'
WHERE project_name = 'CLOUD MIGRATION';
```

* **Standardized project status**
Here, I ensured all statuses were either ‘Active’, ‘Completed’, or ‘Pending’ by replacing other status with 'Pending'. The query is written below.
```sql
UPDATE [Learn SQL].dbo.tech_solutions_data1
SET status = 'Pending'
WHERE status = 'Cancelled';
```
After running this query, 404 were updated.

> [!Tip]
> When done with the modifications, select all the data from the table to confirm that everything has been updated accordingly.

## 𝐓𝐚𝐬𝐤 4: 𝐋𝐨𝐨𝐤𝐞𝐝 𝐚𝐭 𝐍𝐔𝐋𝐋 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐁𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐤 𝐕𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐞𝐬 
This task helped in populating missing data where possible. 

1. Checked for missing values in columns such as end_date, budget, expenditure, and team_members.  
Here, I first identified NULL in each column using the queries below.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM [Learn SQL].dbo.tech_solutions_data1
WHERE end_date IS NULL;
```

```sql
SELECT *
FROM [Learn SQL].dbo.tech_solutions_data1
WHERE budget IS NULL;
```

```sql
SELECT *
FROM [Learn SQL].dbo.tech_solutions_data1
WHERE expenditure IS NULL;
```

```sql
SELECT *
FROM [Learn SQL].dbo.tech_solutions_data1
WHERE team_members IS NULL;
```

2. For budget and expenditure columns, I filled in missing values with the average of those columns.  
* Calculated the average of the budget column
```sql
SELECT 
	AVG(budget)
FROM [Learn SQL].dbo.tech_solutions_data1
WHERE budget IS NOT NULL;
```

* Updated the table with the average of the budget column where the budget is NULL
```sql
UPDATE [Learn SQL].dbo.tech_solutions_data1
SET budget = (
    SELECT 
        Round(AVG(budget), 0)
    FROM [Learn SQL].dbo.tech_solutions_data1
    WHERE budget IS NOT NULL)
WHERE budget IS NULL;
```

* Calculated the average of the expenditure column
```sql
SELECT 
	AVG(expenditure)
FROM [Learn SQL].dbo.tech_solutions_data1
WHERE expenditure IS NOT NULL;
```

* Updated the table with the average of the expenditure column where expenditure is NULL
```sql
UPDATE [Learn SQL].dbo.tech_solutions_data1
SET expenditure = (
    SELECT 
        Round(AVG(expenditure), 0)
    FROM [Learn SQL].dbo.tech_solutions_data1
    WHERE expenditure IS NOT NULL)
WHERE expenditure IS NULL;
```

## 𝐓𝐚𝐬𝐤 𝟓: 𝐅𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐝 𝐨𝐫 𝐑𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐝 𝐄𝐦𝐩𝐭𝐲 𝐭𝐞𝐚𝐦_𝐦𝐞𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐫𝐬 𝐂𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐦𝐧
Here, for empty cells in the team_members column, I checked if I could infer the data based on other columns. So, I:  
* Filled team_members with project_manager where team_members had NULL.
This filled 331 empty cells in the team_members column. The query is given below:
```sql
UPDATE t1 
SET t1.team_members = t2.project_manager
FROM [Learn SQL].dbo.tech_solutions_data1 t1
JOIN [Learn SQL].dbo.tech_solutions_data1 t2
    ON t1.project_id = t2.project_id
WHERE t1.team_members IS NULL  -- This updated 331 rows;
```

* Filled project_manager with the first name in the team_members where project_manager had NULL.  
This filled 83 empty cells in the team_members column. The query was written as follows:
```sql
UPDATE [Learn SQL].dbo.tech_solutions_data1
SET project_manager = 
    CASE 
        WHEN CHARINDEX(',', team_members) > 0 THEN SUBSTRING(team_members, 1, CHARINDEX(',', team_members) - 1)
        ELSE team_members
    END
WHERE project_manager IS NULL;
```
> [!Note]
> In this query,
> * `CHARINDEX(',', team_members)`: Finds the position of the first comma in the team_members column.
> * `SUBSTRING(team_members, 1, CHARINDEX(',', team_members) - 1)`: Extracts the part of the team_members string before the first comma.
> * `ELSE team_members`: Handles rows without a comma in team_members (assigns the entire value if no comma is present).
> * `WHERE project_manager IS NULL`: Ensures only rows with NULL in the project_manager column are updated.

## Removed Invalid Values
Here, I removed any rows with invalid or negative values in the budget column using the query below:
```sql
DELETE FROM [Learn SQL].dbo.tech_solutions_data1
WHERE budget LIKE '-%';
```
The above query removed 54 rows from the table.

## 𝐓𝐚𝐬𝐤 𝟔: 𝐔𝐩𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐓𝐲𝐩𝐞 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐑𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐮𝐞 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚
* Converted all monetary values in the table to the same currency. Here, the budget and expenditure columns were affected.
```sql
UPDATE [Learn SQL].dbo.tech_solutions_data1
SET budget = CAST(budget AS MONEY);
```

```sql
UPDATE [Learn SQL].dbo.tech_solutions_data1
SET expenditure = CAST(expenditure AS MONEY);
```

## 𝐓𝐚𝐬𝐤 𝟕: 𝐔𝐬𝐞𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐓𝐑𝐈𝐌() 𝐅𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐭𝐨 𝐔𝐩𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚
Here, I use TRIM() to remove trailing spaces from the project_name column. The query was written as follows:
```sql
UPDATE [Learn SQL].dbo.tech_solutions_data1
SET project_name = TRIM(TRAILING '' FROM project_name);
```

## 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧
In this project, I wrote queries to clean and prepare data for analysis. Several tasks were completed, such as checking and removing duplicates, looking at NULL and blank values, populating empty cells based on other columns, standardizing the data by checking for incorrect spellings and fixing them to make all data consistent, and converting data to the correct data type where possible.
